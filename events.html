                        <p>Defrag was one of the kernel events of ACM organised during APOGEE-2018, the technical fest of BITS, Pilani. 
                        It is a series of technical lectures on various topics in mathematics and computer science. After a hugely successful inaugural edition with talks on blockchain and virtual storytelling in 2017, Defragâ€™18 witnessed talks on topics like computer vision, polynomial automorphism, privacy in social media among others.
                        The key speaker on the event was Dr. David G. Stork, a renowned researcher and scientist in the field of computer vision, Dr. Stork engaged an audience of more than 750 people. The other key speakers included eminent personalities from computer science and mathematical backgrounds including Dr. Neena Gupta, Dr. P Kumaragura, Dr. Sachin Lodha and Mr. Abhishek Syal.
                        Defrag'18 was thus a huge success.</p>

These lectures are conducted by second and third year students and combine a brief introduction to the with hands-on experience. The game development SIG focused on the basics of Unity. The Web development SIGs covered various topics of front-end and back-end development including html, css, javascript and django frameworks. The app development SIG covered topics like basic and advanced java followed by beginner and intermediate level mobile app development using android studio.
                        The lectures  see participation of those willing to develop skills in these domain. At the end of each lecture, an array of basic projects related to the field are provided along with more learning resources. </p>

The session opened with a brief talk given by previous year project and paper presentation winners. It was meant to give an insight into the process of writing a technical paper or developing and working on a project idea. This was followed by a brainstorming session where the participants discussed various ideas for computing related projects. The take-home from the session was not only the great ideas but also a strongly motivated and computing enthusiastic peer group.</p>
